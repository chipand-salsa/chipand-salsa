## Hello!

Hi! I'm a Canadian school student that likes coding in python and html.

Im very new to coding and learning python and html, so sorry if my code looks atrocious!
I am currently working on a Model United Nations software to make conferences easier.

I enjoy playing video games, of course coding, 3d modeling and printing, and tinkering with electrical and mehcanical devices. 
You can contact me on discord at chipsandsalsa, im pretty active so ill try and respond as soon as i can.

See ya!
