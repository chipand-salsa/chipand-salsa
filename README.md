## Hello!

Hi! I'm a Canadian school student that likes coding in python, especially using the py-cord library.

Im very new to coding and learning python, so sorry if my code looks atrocious!
I am currently working on a discord bot for the game torn.com, this bot is mostly focused on making faction management easier, especially with new players.

I enjoy playing video games, of course coding, 3d modeling and printing, and tinkering with electrical and mehcanical devices. 
You can contact me on discord at chipsandsalsa, im pretty active so ill try and respond as soon as i can.

See ya!
